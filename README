Generic::Assertions

"Generic::Assertions" allows you to create portable containers of
classes of assertions, and allows keeping severity of assertions from
their implementation.

Basic implementation entails

*   Defining a list of things to test for

*   Returning a pair of ( OK / NOT_OK , "reason" ) for the tests
    conclusion

*   [optional] Defining a default handler for various classes of
    severity ( "should", "must" etc. )

*   [optional] Defining an input transform (eg: always converting the
    first argument to a path)

*   Invoking the assertion at the callpoint as
    "$instance->severity_level( test_name => @args_for_test )"
